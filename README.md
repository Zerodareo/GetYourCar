# Get-Your-Car-
Hey there and welcome !


Few words about this project : so initially i wanted to create a simple website where we could easily look up for electrical vehicules and their electric charging station depending on the location of the user
But more than that i've decided to make it more diverse and made it like a "go-to" website, a website where people could lean on when they are in need of that website.
Since it would be too long to put one by one vehicules, i'm currently working on making the user a part of the project for the vehicules research and their electrical stations.
"Get Your Car !" allow the user to compare the stats of each vehicules, their forces and weaknesses and they can have a look at where they could easily find their recharging areas on a roadmap from Google Maps
Depending of my progress, i'll able to make it viable enough to be used by people, with some features coming later ( one where each time the user look for a vehicule in the researching bar, his research is added to the database automatically and redirect him on a page with the image of his vehicule and some random stats, i'm planning to add an API for that)
